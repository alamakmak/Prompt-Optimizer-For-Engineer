## 2026-02-10 - Project Setup Log

### 🚀 Prompt Optimizer for Engineer
- Created GitHub repository: [alanakmak/Prompt-Optimizer-For-Engineer](https://github.com/alamakmak/Prompt-Optimizer-For-Engineer)
- Initial commit with README (2026-02-10 08:31 UTC)
- Project plan created at `project_doc/1-Project-Plan.md`

### ⚙️ Tool Setup
- Installed `auto-commit` skill (GitHub integration)
- Installed `vercel-deploy` skill (Vercel deployment)
- Installed `ai-dev-tool` for:
  - Unified input handling
  - Context management
  - Project documentation system

### 📌 Key Decisions
- **No mode-switching UI** (all input processing via single card)
- **Confidence levels mandatory** for all extracted elements
- **Image prioritization** when both image+text input exists
- Auto-commit to GitHub every 15 minutes enabled

### 📅 Next Steps
1. Implement Vision Analyzer (priority: high)
2. Set up Vercel deployment pipeline
3. Test with sample UI screenshot
